We combined the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort small to medium sized unsorted arrays so we can sort them and then Binary search to find the element we are looking for within the arrays.
Particularly :
- There are two tables, the 1st simply 'stores' the students' codes and checks which students in the given case have collected more than 70%.
- Another 2nd table which holds the points that are above tangible 70%.
So everyone with their password could search where they are in the 'ranking' but also what their position is compared to the others.
